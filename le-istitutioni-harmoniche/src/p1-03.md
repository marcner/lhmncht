## CHAPTER THREE: TO WHAT END MUSIC SHOULD BE LEARNED

---

Since it has been said above that the well-instructed man should not be without Music, therefore wishing to learn it, before we pass further, I wish us to see what end he should propose to himself, since there have been diverse opinions about this; and having seen this, we will see also the utility that comes from Music and in what manner we should use it.

Beginning therefore from the first, I say that there have been some who held the opinion that Music should be learned to give pleasure and delight to the hearing, for no other reason than to make this sense perfect, in the way that sight becomes perfect when with delight and pleasure it regards a beautiful and proportionate thing. But in truth it should not be learned for this end, for this is a thing of common folk and mechanics: for these things do not have in themselves any part of the virtuous (although calming the mind they have something delightful) and are things of coarse men, who seek nothing but to satisfy the sense, and to this sole end they attend.

Others then wished that it should be learned for no other end than to be placed among the liberal disciplines, in which only the nobles exercised themselves; and because it disposes the mind to virtue and regulates its passions, accustoming it to rejoice and grieve virtuously, disposing it to good customs, no differently than Gymnastics does for the body to some good disposition and habit; and also so that by such means one could come to the speculation of diverse sorts of harmony: since through it the intellect knows the nature of musical consonances. And although this end has something honest about it, it is nevertheless not sufficient: for he who learns Music does not learn it only to acquire the perfection of the intellect; but to be able, when he ceases from the cares and business both of the body and of the mind—that is, when he is at leisure and outside of daily occupations—to pass the time and entertain himself virtuously; so that living rightly and laudably distant from laziness, by such means he may become more prudent and then pass to doing better and more laudable things. Which end is not only worthy of praise and honest, but is the true end: for Music was not discovered or ordained to any other end than to that which we have shown above, as the Philosopher manifests in his Politics, adducing and recounting many authorities of Homer.

Whence deservedly the ancients placed it in the order of those entertainments that serve free men and among laudable disciplines, and not among the necessary ones, as is Arithmetic; nor even among the useful ones, as are some which are for the acquisition only of exterior goods, which are riches and the utility of the family; nor among some others which serve for the health of the body and for strength, like Gymnastics, which is an art pertaining to things that help to make the body healthy and strong, such as wrestling, throwing the javelin, and other things that pertain to the exercise of war.

One should therefore learn Music not as necessary but as liberal and honest, so that by its means we may come to a good and virtuous habit that leads us in the way of good customs, making us walk to other more useful and more necessary sciences, and makes us pass the time virtuously. And this should be the principal or ultimate intention, whichever we wish to call it. But in what mode it has the power to induce new customs and move the mind to diverse passions, we will reason about in another place.
