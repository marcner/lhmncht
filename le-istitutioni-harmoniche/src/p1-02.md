## CHAPTER TWO: ON THE PRAISES OF MUSIC

---

Although through its origin and certainty its praises are clearly manifest, nevertheless when I consider that nothing can be found which does not have a very great connection with Music, I cannot pass over it entirely in silence. And although what has been written about it by so many excellent Philosophers should suffice, nevertheless I do not wish to refrain from my duty to discourse on some things about it: for although I will not say all the praises that belong to it, I will at least touch upon a minimal portion of the most notable and excellent ones; and I will do this with as much brevity as possible.

How celebrated Music has been and held as a sacred thing is most clearly attested by the ancient writings of Philosophers, and especially of the Pythagoreans: for they held the opinion that the World was composed musically, and that the heavens in their turning caused harmony, and that our soul was formed with the same reason, to be awakened by songs and sounds and almost vivify its virtues. So much so that by some of them it was written that Music among the liberal arts holds the primacy, and by some it was called enkyklios paideia, from enkyklos, a Greek word meaning Circle, and paideia Disciplineâ€”as if to say the circle of sciences: for Music, as Plato says, embraces all disciplines, as can be known by examination. For if we begin with Grammar, first among the seven liberal arts, we will find what we have said to be true; for great harmony is heard in the arrangement and proportionate order of words, from which if the Grammarian departs, he makes the ears hear a displeasing sound of his speech: for one can barely listen to or read that prose or verse which is devoid of polished, beautiful, ornate, sonorous, and elegant order.

In Dialectic, whoever well considers and examines the proportion of Syllogisms will see with marvelous concert and very great pleasure to the hearing, that truth is shown to be greatly distant from falsehood. The Orator then in his Oration, using musical accents at the proper times, provides marvelous delight to listeners; which the great orator Demosthenes knew very well: for asked three times what was the principal part in the Orator, three times he replied that pronunciation was above every other thing. This was also known (as Cicero and Valerius Maximus demonstrate) by Gaius Gracchus, a man of supreme eloquence: for whenever he had to speak before the people, he kept behind him a servant who was a most perfect musician, who secretly with an ivory Flute gave him the measure, that is, the voice or tone of pronunciation in such a way that whenever he saw him too elevated he restrained him, and seeing him too lowered he incited him.

But then poetry is clearly seen to be so conjoined with music that whoever wished to separate it from music would remain almost as a body separated from the soul. This is confirmed by Plato in the Gorgias, saying: That if anyone should remove from all poetry the melody and number with the measure together, there would be no difference between it and domestic and popular speech. And therefore we see that poets have used very great diligence and marvelous artifice in accommodating words in verses and arranging feet according to the convenience of speech; as Virgil observed throughout his entire poem: for to all three sorts of his speech he accommodates the proper sonority of the verse with such artifice that he properly seems with the sound of words to place before the eyes the things of which he comes to treat. So that where he speaks of love, one sees that he has artfully chosen some soft, sweet, pleasant words and most pleasing to the hearing; and where it was necessary for him to sing of a deed of arms, describe a naval battle, a storm at sea, or similar things where bloodshed, wrath, anger, displeasures of mind enter, and every hateful thing, he made choice of hard, harsh, and displeasing words: so that in hearing and uttering them they bring fear.

And to give some example of this, he, in showing the poverty of Meliboeus's hut, diminishes that word Tuguri by one letter, almost showing with it the present effect; as he also did when he wished to manifest the sorrow of that Nymph who was forced to abandon the pleasing sight of her shepherd; for in that verse "Et longum formose vale, vale (inquit) Iola," making the verse almost interrupted by weeping and sighs, he makes that syllable long which he had first placed short. Then wishing to show how swift Time is, he demonstrates it with a verse composed of many Dactyls, which are feet apt for velocity and to show such an effect, saying: "Sed fugit interea fugit irreparabile tempus." I will now leave off saying how, wishing to show the Carthaginians always enemies and contrary to the Romans, in describing the site of Carthage, he purposely placed that word which should go before, and said: "Italiam contra." And wishing to demonstrate with how much silence the city of Troy was assaulted by the Greeks, he shows it with a verse composed of many Spondees, which are feet by their nature apt for slowness and for weak and idle things, saying: "Invadunt urbem somno vinoque sepultam"; and infinite others which would be too long to recount in this place, of which the work is full. It will suffice now for the ultimate conclusion to say that poetry would be without any grace if it were not given by harmoniously placed words.

Beyond this, I will leave aside saying how much similarity and union Arithmetic and Geometry have with it; and I will say only that if the Architect did not have knowledge of Music, as Vitruvius well demonstrates, he would not know how reasonably to make the tempering of machines, and in Theaters to place the vessels, and dispose buildings well and musically. Astronomy likewise, if it were not aided by harmonic foundations, would not know the good and evil influences. Indeed I will say more: if the Astronomer did not know the concordance of the seven planets and when one is conjoined with the other, or one is opposed to the other, he would never predict future things. Philosophy also, which has as its proper function to discourse with reason on things produced by nature and possible to produce, does it not confess that all things depend on the prime mover and are ordered with such marvelous order that there results in the universe a tacit harmony? Behold, first heavy things hold the low place, light things the high, and those of less weight, according to their nature, possess the middle place.

And proceeding further, the Philosophers affirm that the Heavens in revolving make harmony; which although we do not hear, this can happen either through their swift revolution, or through the excessive distance, or through another cause hidden to us. Medicine cannot stand far from this: for if the physician does not have knowledge of Music, how will he know how to proportion hot things with cold in his medicines according to their degrees? And how can he have optimal knowledge of pulses? Which the most learned Herophilus disposed according to the order of musical numbers.

And to rise higher, our Theology, placing in heaven infinite angelic spirits, divides them into nine Choirs and three Hierarchies, as Dionysius the Areopagite writes. These are continually present at the sight of the Divine Majesty and do not cease to sing Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts, as is written in Isaiah. And not only these, but the four Animals also, which in the book of his Revelations are described by Saint John, give praise before the throne of God and sing the same song. Then stand the twenty-four elders before the immaculate Lamb, and with the sound of Harps and most high voices they sing to the Most High God a new song, which is also sung by the voices of Harpists playing on their harps together with the four animals and twenty-four elders. Of these and other almost infinite things pertaining to our purpose the divine Scripture is full, which for brevity we will pass over, it being sufficient only to say for the supreme praise of Music that without making mention of any other science, it alone, according to the testimony of the sacred books, is found in Paradise and is most nobly exercised there. And as in the celestial court it is called Triumphant, so in our earthly court, which is called Militant, with nothing other than Music is the Creator praised and thanked.

But let us now leave aside the superior things and return to those which are produced by nature for the ornament of the world, for we will see everything full of musical concerts. The Sea first has the Sirens, which, if it is permitted to give faith to the writers, make themselves heard to sailors in such a way that, often overcome by their harmony and overcome by sleep, they lose that which above every other thing is most dear to all animals. In the Air and on the Earth together sound the birds, which also with their concerts delight and recreate not only weary minds full of troublesome thoughts but also bodies; for the traveler, often tired from the long journey, recreates his mind, rests his body, and forgets past fatigues through the sweet harmony of the rustic songs of birds of so many various sorts that it would be impossible to recount them. The Rivers and Fountains likewise, fabricated by nature, are wont to give pleasant pleasure to whoever is found near them; and the shepherdess often, to recreate herself, accompanies her rustic song with their noisy concerts.

All these things the most learned Virgil expressed with few words when he said that to the song of Silenus not only the Fauns and other beasts but even the hard Oaks danced; those leaping and these often moving with numerous movements, indicating to us that not only sensible things but also those lacking sense are almost ready and conquered by musical concerts, and become from hard and harsh, gentle and pleasant.

But if so much harmony is found in celestial and terrestrial things, or to speak better, if the world was composed by the Creator full of so much harmony, why should we believe Man to be deprived of it? And if the Soul of the World (as some hold) is nothing other than Harmony, could it be that our Soul is not in us the cause of all harmony and that it is not harmoniously conjoined with the body? Especially since God created man in the likeness of the greater World, called by the Greeks Kosmos, that is ornament or adorned; and having made him in that likeness of lesser quantity, in difference from that he is called mikrokosmos, that is little world: certainly this is not a reasonable thing. Whence Aristotle, wishing to show the musical composition of man, very well said that the vegetative part has to the sensitive, and this to the intellective, the same correspondence that the figure of three sides has to that of four. It is therefore certain that nothing good is found that does not have musical disposition; and Music truly, beyond cheering the mind, also reduces man to the contemplation of celestial things; and has such property that everything to which it is added becomes perfect; and those men are truly happy and blessed who are endowed with it, as the Holy Prophet affirms, saying: Blessed is that people who know jubilation.

By which authority Fulgentius, Bishop of Ruspe, a Catholic doctor, expounding Psalm 65, was moved to say that Music is necessary to the Christian man; For in the science of it beatitude is found. Whence for this I have the boldness to say that those who have no knowledge of this science are to be numbered among the ignorant. In ancient times, as Isidore says, it was no less shameful not to know Music than letters. Therefore it is no wonder if Hesiod, a most famous and most ancient poet, as Pausanias narrates, was excluded from the contest as one who had never learned to play the Harp nor to accompany song with its sound. So also Themistocles, as Cicero narrates, refusing to play the Lyre at the banquet, was reputed less learned and less esteemed.

The contrary we read was in great esteem among the ancients: Linus and Orpheus, both sons of the Gods: for with their sweet song (as is said) they not only sweetened human minds but also beasts and birds; and what is more marvelous to say, moved stones from their proper places and retained rivers in their courses. And this same thing the learned Horace attributed to Amphion, saying: "Dictus and Amphion Thebanae conditor arcis / Saxa movere sono testudinis, et prece blanda / Ducere quo vellet." From these perhaps the Pythagoreans learned that with musical sounds they softened fierce minds; and Asclepiades likewise, who many times by this way calmed discord born in the people, and with the sound of the Trumpet restored hearing to the deaf. Likewise Damon the Pythagorean reduced with song to temperate and honest life some youths given to wine and lust. And therefore those spoke well who affirmed Music to be a certain law and rule of modesty. And I say that Theophrastus found certain musical Modes to calm perturbed spirits. Therefore deservedly and wisely Diogenes the Cynic mocked the Musicians of his times, who, having the strings of their harps concordant, had minds discordant and disordered, being abandoned by the harmony of good customs.

And if we should give faith to history, what we have said should seem almost nothing to us: for much greater is having the power to heal the sick than to correct the life of unbridled youths, as we also read of Xenocrates, who with the sound of organs reduced the mad to pristine health; and of Thales of Candia, who with the sound of the Harp drove out the pestilence. And we see today that through Music marvelous things are worked: for so great is the force of sounds and dances against the poison of Tarantulas that in the briefest time it heals those who have been bitten by them, as is seen every day by experience in Apulia, a country most abundant in such animals.

But without more profane testimonies, do we not have in the Sacred Letters that the prophet David calmed the evil spirit of Saul with the sound of his Harp? And for this I believe that this royal Prophet ordained that in the Temple of God songs and harmonic sounds should be used, knowing that they were apt to gladden spirits and return men to the contemplation of celestial things. The Prophets also (as Ambrose says on Psalm 118), wishing to prophesy, asked that someone skilled in sound should set himself to play; so that softened by that sweetness, spiritual grace might be infused into them. Therefore Elisha did not wish to prophesy to the King of Israel what he should do for the acquisition of waters so that the armies would not die of thirst, if first a Musician was not brought to his presence to sing; and as he sang, he was inspired by the divine Spirit and predicted everything.

But let us pass further, for examples do not lack. Timotheus (as the Great Basil narrates together with many others) with Music incited King Alexander to combat; and the same being incited, calmed him. Aristotle narrates in the book on the nature of animals that Deer are captured by the song of hunters and are also much delighted by the pastoral Bagpipe and song; which Pliny confirms in his natural history. And not to extend myself further on this, I will only say that I know some who have seen Deer that, stopping their course, stood attentive to hear the sound of the Lyre and of the Lute; and likewise we see every day birds conquered and deceived by harmony, most often remaining captured by the fowler. Pliny also narrates that Music saved Arion from death, for when he threw himself into the sea, he was carried by a Dolphin to the shore of Tenarus island.

But let us now leave aside many other examples that we could adduce, and let us speak a little of the good Socrates, master of Plato, who already old and full of wisdom wished to learn to play the harp; and old Chiron, among the first arts that he taught Achilles in tender age, was Music; and he wished that his bloodthirsty hands, before they were stained with Trojan blood, should play the Harp. Plato and Aristotle do not allow that the well-instructed man should be without Music: indeed they persuade with many reasons that such a science should be learned, and they show the force of Music to be very great in us; and therefore they wish that from childhood one should apply oneself to it: for it is sufficient to induce in us a new good habit and such a custom that guides and leads to virtue and renders the mind more capable of happiness. And the most severe Lycurgus, King of the Lacedaemonians, among his most severe laws praised and most highly approved Music; for he knew very well that it was very necessary to man and of very great benefit in matters of war; so that his armies (as Valerius narrates) never went to fight if first they were not well heated and animated by the sound of Fifes.

Such a custom is also observed in our times; for one of two armies would not assault the enemy if not invited by the sound of Trumpets and Drums or by some other sort of musical instruments. And although, beyond those narrated, infinite other examples are not lacking from which the dignity and excellence of Music could be better known, nevertheless, not to go on longer, we will leave them, it being sufficient what has been reasoned until now.
