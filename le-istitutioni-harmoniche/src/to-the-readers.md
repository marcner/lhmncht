## AI LETTORI (TO THE READERS)

If I see, my most kind readers, that these labors of mine are truly dear to you, I will strive to give you, as soon as I can make it, these same institutions made in the Latin language, along with the HARMONIC DEMONSTRATIONS mentioned in several places of this work, and some other things besides, to which I have not yet (as they say) put the final hand. In the meantime, read with a cheerful and sincere spirit that which I have labored over for many years to benefit you. And if you find anything that does not fully satisfy you, remember that I am human; and I do not think, as that good old Terentian used to say, that anything pertaining to man is foreign to me. I mean to infer that it could very well be that I have erred in something, since we are all subject to such law. And that this is true, you can now recognize from the fact that despite all the diligence that has been used in printing, it has not been possible to prevent some errors from occurring in several sheets of some books (though not in all); which you will gladly correct before you begin reading. By doing this, you will show how kind you are in pardoning those [errors] that might be (if any are found) of some importance and cannot be understood except by the intellect. The first number is that of the page of the work, and the second that of the line.
