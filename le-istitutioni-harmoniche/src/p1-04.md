## CHAPTER FOUR: ON THE UTILITY THAT ONE HAS FROM MUSIC, AND THE STUDY THAT WE SHOULD PUT INTO IT, AND IN WHAT MODE TO USE IT

---

Great truly is the utility that is taken from Music when we use it temperately: for it is a manifest thing that not only man, who is capable of reason, but also many of the other animals that lack it, we comprehend that they take delight and pleasure: for delighting and rejoicing every animal in the proportion and tempering of things, and finding in harmonies such qualities, there immediately follows pleasure and delight common to all the living. And it is truly a reasonable thing, since nature consists in such proportion and tempering, that every like delights in its like and desires it.

Of this, infants barely born give most clear indication, who, taken by the sweetness of the song of the voices of their nurses, not only after long weeping are calmed but become cheerful, also often making some festive gestures. And Music is so natural to us, so conjoined to us in a certain way, that we see each one in a certain mode wanting to say something about it, even if imperfectly. For which reason one could say that he who is not composed with harmony does not take delight in Music: for (as we have said) if all delight and pleasure is born from likeness, it is necessary that he who has no pleasure in harmony, in a certain way does not find it in him and is ignorant of it. And if one wishes to examine the matter well, one will find such a person to be of most base disposition and without any judgment; and one could say that nature failed him, not having proportionately formed his organ: for that part which is in the middle of the brain, being closer to the ear, when it is proportionate and well composed, serves in a certain way for the judgment of harmony, by which man, as by a final thing, is taken and conquered, and in it takes much pleasure.

But if it happens that it is deprived of such proportion, much less does it take delight in any other of it; and it is as apt for speculative and ingenious things as the Ass is for the Lyre. And if we wish in this to follow the opinion of the Astrologers, we will say that at his birth Mercury was made his enemy, as he is favorable to those who not only of harmony take delight, but do not disdain, for the alleviation of their fatigues, to sing and play themselves, recreating their spirit and reacquiring their lost forces. And therefore nature has well ordained that, having in us, through the spirit, conjoined together (as the Platonists hold) body and Soul; to each of them, being weak and infirm, it has provided opportune remedies: for the Body, languid and infirm, comes to be healed with remedies that Medicine provides; and the Spirit, afflicted and weak, by aerial spirits and by sounds and songs that are proportionate remedies to it. The Soul then, enclosed in this corporeal prison, is consoled by way of the high and divine mysteries of sacred Theology.

Such utility therefore Music brings us, and more: that chasing away the tedium that is taken from fatigues, it makes us cheerful, and doubles and preserves cheerfulness. We see Soldiers go to assault the enemy much more ferociously, incited by the sound of Trumpets and Drums; and not only they, but Horses also move with great impetus. This excites the mind, moves the affections, mitigates and calms fury, makes time pass virtuously, and has the power to generate in us a habit of good customs; especially when with due modes and temperately it is used: for being the proper office of Music to delight, not dishonestly but honestly we should use it; so that what is wont to happen to those who immoderately drink Wine does not happen to us—who then, heated, harm themselves and, doing a thousand foolish things, move to laughter whoever sees them. Not because the nature of Wine is so malign that when temperately drunk it does not work good effect in man: but it shows itself such to him who drinks it avidly: for all things are good when temperately they are used for that end for which they have been discovered and ordained; but when they are intemperately used and not according to the due end, they harm and are pernicious.

So that we can hold this for true: that not only natural things, but every art and every science can be good and bad, according to how they are used: good, I say, when they are directed to that end to which they have been ordained; and bad when they distance themselves from that end. Man therefore being born for much more excellent things than Singing or playing the Lyre or other sorts of instruments to satisfy only the sense of hearing, makes bad use of his nature and deviates from his proper end, little caring to give food to the intellect, which always desires to know and understand new things.

Man therefore should not only learn the art of Music, withdrawing from other sciences, abandoning his end, which would be great foolishness: but he should learn it for that end to which it has been ordained. Nor should he spend time only in it: but he should accompany it with the study of speculation, so that aided by that, he can come to greater knowledge of the things that pertain to its use; and through this use he can reduce to act that which through long study speculating he has investigated: for accompanied in this way it brings utility to every science and to every art, as at other times we have seen. And if it were done otherwise, there would not be in it such a thing of much utility nor of much glory; indeed vice would be attributed to him: for to exercise oneself continuously in it without any other study induces sleepiness and laziness and renders minds soft and effeminate.

Which thing the ancients knowing, wished that the study of Music should be conjoined to Gymnastics: nor did they wish that one could apply oneself to one without the other; and this they did so that by giving oneself too much to Music, the mind would not come to make itself vile; and giving oneself only to Gymnastics, minds would not become excessively fierce, cruel, and inhuman: but from these two exercises joined together they would render themselves humane, modest, and temperate. And they moved to this with reason, which clearly can be seen, that those who in youth, abandoning the studies of things of greater importance, have given themselves only to consorting with musicians and parasites, always standing in the schools of games, of dances, and of lutes, playing the Lyre and the Lute, and singing songs less than honest, are soft, effeminate, and without any good custom. For Music used in such a way renders the minds of youths badly composed, as Ovid well demonstrated, saying:

*Enervant animos citharae, cantusque lyraequae,*
*Et vox, et numeris brachia mota suis.*

They reason about nothing other than such things, nor do any but dishonest words come from their filthy mouths. On the contrary, there are some who through such study become not only soft and effeminate but also importunate, displeasing, proud, pertinacious, and inhuman: so much so that seeing themselves arrived at a certain point, esteeming themselves above every other excellent person, they glory, they exalt themselves, they praise themselves, and vituperating others, to appear themselves full of wisdom and judgment, they stand with the greatest reputation and pride in the world. Nor ever, except with great insistence of prayers and with praises much greater than is fitting for them, can they be reduced to showing a little of their knowledge. For which reason in all these the saying of Horace is verified, which says:

*Omnibus hoc vitium est cantoribus, inter amicos,*
*Ut nunquam inducant animum cantare rogati,*
*Injussi nunquam desistant.*

For such people it would have been necessary that their fathers should rather have had them taught some other trade, however vile, for perhaps they would not have fallen into such errors and would have acquired better customs. I have wished to say all this so that those who wish to make profession of the art of Music will fall in love with the science and give themselves to the study of speculation: for I do not doubt that by joining these things together, they will not come to become virtuous, honest, and well-mannered, and in such a way will come to imitate the ancients, who (as has been said) accompanied Music with Gymnastics: for thus it will be powerful to reduce each one to the straight path of good customs. Nor should anyone believe that what I have said about the art of Music I have said either to vituperate it or those who exercise themselves in such a manner—a thing that has never entered my mind—but rather I have said it so that, conjoined in such a way and with other honorable sciences full of severity, we may defend it from the vagabond and idle ruffianisms of the jugglers, and place it in its true place, so that it does not have to serve those who are given only to voluptuousness, but be for the use of the studious of good sciences and of those who follow the virtues, living moderately and civilly.
