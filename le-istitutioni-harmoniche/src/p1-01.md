## CHAPTER ONE: ON THE ORIGIN AND CERTAINTY OF MUSIC

---

Since the Supreme and Most Excellent God, through His infinite goodness, has granted man the ability to be with stones, to grow with trees, and to sense in common with other animals; yet as He wished that from the excellence of this creature His omnipotence might be known, He endowed him with intellect, so that he differs little from the angels. And so that man might know his beginning and end to be in God, He created him with his face directed toward heaven, where is the seat of God Himself, and this so that he would not fix his love on base and earthly things, but would raise his intellect to contemplate the superior and celestial things, and penetrate to the hidden and divine through the means of things that exist and are comprehended through the five senses. And although two alone would have been sufficient for mere existence; nevertheless for well-being He added three more: for if through touch we know hard and rough things from soft and polished ones; and through taste we distinguish sweet foods from bitter ones; through these two senses we feel the difference between cold and heat, hard and soft, heavy and light—things that would merely suffice for our existence. Nevertheless, for well-being, seeing, hearing, and smelling are necessary; through which man comes to reject what is bad and choose what is good. Of these, whoever wishes to properly estimate their virtue will undoubtedly find that sight, considered by itself, is of greater utility to the body and consequently more necessary than the others. But one will then recognize that hearing is much more necessary and better when considered incidentally in matters pertaining to the intellect: for although through the sense of sight more differences of things are known—being that it extends more than hearing—nevertheless hearing extends more in the acquisition of Sciences and intellectual judgment, and brings us much greater utility. Whence it follows that hearing is truly both more necessary and better than the other senses; although all five are called instruments of the intellect: for everything that we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell is presented to it through the means of the senses and common sense; nor can it have knowledge of anything except through the means of one of these five; it being true that all our knowledge has its origin from them.

From hearing, therefore, as from the most necessary of the other senses, the science of Music has had its origin; whose nobility can easily be demonstrated through its antiquity: for (as Moses, Josephus, and Berosus the Chaldean say) before the universal flood it was discovered by Jubal of the lineage of Cain from the sound of hammers. But lost afterward by the aforementioned flood, it was newly discovered by Mercury: for (as Diodorus holds) he was the first who observed the course of the stars, the harmony of song, and the proportions of numbers. And he also says that he was the inventor of the Lyre with three strings; of which opinion was also Lucian; although Lactantius, in the book he wrote on False Religion, attributes the invention of the Lyre to Apollo; and Pliny holds that Amphion was the inventor of Music. But be that as it may, Boethius, approaching the opinion of Macrobius and departing from Diodorus, holds that Pythagoras was the one who discovered the reason of musical proportions from the sound of hammers: For passing by a blacksmith's shop, where they were beating heated iron on the anvil with various hammers, there came to his ears a certain order of sounds that moved his hearing with delight; and stopping for a while, he began to investigate whence such an effect proceeded; and it seeming to him first that it could proceed from the unequal forces of the men, he had those who were beating exchange hammers: but not hearing a sound different from that of before, he judged (as was true) that the diversity of the weight of the hammers was the cause. For which reason, having had each weighed separately, he found among the numbers of the weights the ratios of consonances and harmonies; which he then industriously increased in this way: having made strings of sheep gut of equal thickness, attaching to them the same weights of the hammers, he found the same consonances; all the more sonorous, as the strings by their nature render sound
