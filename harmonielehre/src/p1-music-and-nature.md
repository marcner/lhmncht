## ยง1. Music and Nature

All arts, with the exception of music, are essentially idea-associations of nature and reality, generally large and far-reaching idea-associations. Generally, nature is the model that art imitates, whether in word, color, or form. We know immediately which part of nature the word means, which the color means, and which the plastic work signifies. This is different in music. Here, any such unambiguous association with nature is absent from the outset. This deficiency alone is probably the only reason why music cannot transcend a primitive stage among primitive peoples. I would even like to assert, against all traditions and historical accounts, that Greek music was never truly art in the same way; that it could disappear so loudly and tracelessly only because it was still in its beginnings, while all other arts of the Greek people have been preserved to this day as models. Obviously, no human activity can develop without the aid of idea-associations, whether it be comprehension or creative power.
