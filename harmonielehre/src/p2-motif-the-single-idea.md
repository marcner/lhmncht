## ยง2. Motif as the Single Idea-Association of Music

But where should music take the necessary idea-associations from, since nature itself denies them to it? In fact, the occupation with material took unheard-of difficulties and many centuries of idea-associations to claim. Finally, the idea-association of music was discovered: it was the motif.

The motif, and only this alone, is the single idea-association at all that music demonstrates. It is the first fundamental and, above all, innate association. The motif is therefore called upon to replace for music what the other arts gain as a counterpart, namely the eternal and powerful idea-association of nature.
