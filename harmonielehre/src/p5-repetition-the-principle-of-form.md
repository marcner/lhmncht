If it has thus succeeded, in the small and smallest, to give meaning to the tones, one could dare to carry out the same principle in the large as well. For one experiences what a small series of tones means only when and after it has been set once more, so it is evident that also a chain of several small series simply arrives at the revelation of its meaning through repetition. Thus arose the bipartite form a : a or to designate it more clearly: a₁ : a₂.
