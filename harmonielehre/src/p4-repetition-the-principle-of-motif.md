## §4. Repetition as the Principle of the Motif

Motif is a series of tones that has arrived at repetition. Every series of tones can become a motif, but it is only recognized as such when the repetition immediately follows. As long as the immediate repetition is missing, the series, even when it is subsequently elevated somewhere in the artwork to the rank of a motif, is provisionally only to be regarded as an independent component of a higher whole.

First, repetition may elevate a series of tones to something definite, first it may explain what the series is and what it wants; actually therefore it is the repetition that performs the same service for the original series as the mentioned idea-associations of nature do for the creations of the other arts. (See Example No. 1 and No. 2.)

### Musical Examples

#### Example 1
**Beethoven, Piano Sonata Op. 22**
*Allegro con brio*

[Musical notation showing the opening measures with repeated motifs in both hands]

---

#### Example 2
**Mozart, Piano Sonata in A minor, K. 310**
*Allegro maestoso*

[Musical notation showing the opening theme with characteristic repeated patterns and accompaniment]

*Note: u. s. w. = und so weiter (and so on)*

### Repetition and Individuation in Music

Just as man repeats himself in man, the tree in the tree, in short, every creature in its own kind—and only in its own kind—repeats itself, whereby first the concept of man, tree, etc. forms, so the musical series first becomes an individual in the world of tones when it repeats itself in the series. And as in all nature, so also in music the drive of reproduction manifests itself, through which precisely that repetition is set in scene.

One gets used to finally seeing the tones as creatures; one gets used to perceiving biological drives in them, as they dwell within living beings. Have we not already here before us an equation:

**In nature:** Reproductive drive — Repetition — individual species;

**In the world of tones just so:** Reproductive drive — Repetition — individual motif.

Of course, this musical equation, as which the repetition presents itself, does not always need to be a slavish, completely identical one, also freer repetitions and imitations that are also diverse, small contrasts in themselves, raise the miraculous effect of the association nevertheless not always.

Finally, it would be worth noting that music not only requires the associative effect of more or less exact repetition in the melodic, but also in its other elements (such as in rhythm, in harmony, etc.) to individually demarcate the manifold phenomena.

### Musical Examples

#### Example 3
**Beethoven, Piano Sonata Op. 90, First Movement**
*Mit Lebhaftigkeit und durchaus mit Empfindung und Ausdruck*
(With liveliness and throughout with feeling and expression)

[Musical notation showing the opening theme with specific performance instructions]

*Note: As one can see, the upbeat to the first measure (content of the first bracket) is repeated with a subsequent eighth rest. Below the second bracket the upbeat is repeated back even unchanged, below the third and fourth brackets, however, each contains a contrast: from the eighth note a full eighth becomes a quarter with portamento.*

#### Example 4
**Beethoven, same work, Last Movement**

[Musical notation showing main theme with crescendo markings and modulation section]

*Note: Here it is clearly recognizable how independently of melodic and formal elements a rhythmic*

### Motif Formation and Modulation

Motif can be formed. The genius of this case consists precisely in the fact that formally the main idea and the modulation section (in measure 6 of our example) are clearly layered one upon another, but still at the beginning of the first with full abstraction (one observes the Forte instruction) a mere rhythmic motif is created, which radiates across that separation into the modulation section and experiences its obligatory repetitions here.


### Musical Example 5

#### J. Haydn, String Quartet in G minor, Op. 74
*Allegro*

##### Instrumentation:
- Violin I
- Violin II
- Viola
- Violoncello

[Musical notation showing the opening measures of the quartet with all four instruments]

*Note: In this example, Viola and Cello (see the second bracket) bring the association of the first measure (first bracket) faithfully and with portamento in the Viola.*

*u. s. w. = und so weiter (and so on)*

### Musical Example 6

#### Beethoven, Piano Sonata Op. 53, First Movement
*Allegro con brio*

[Musical notation showing the opening theme with markings for E-minor and II. Stufe (II. degree)]

*Note: The association indicated by the brackets reveals within these same motifs and the same diatonic a harmonic contrast of nature, namely the contrast of diatonic II degree F# and "Phrygian" II degree F in E minor.*
