# Preface

The present work is an attempt to create a bridge—a real and practical bridge from composition to theory, in contrast to those theoretical works of other authors who present their theories quite apart from art, as if for their own sake. If this goal is noble and worth striving for, and if the path as a whole has been correctly chosen, then the work will best speak for itself and its merits will emerge clearly even without the prelude of an extensive foreword. However, I believe I must offer an explanation here on several points.

From the critique of previous teaching methods presented in §90 ff., it follows, first, that all voice-leading exercises, as they have hitherto functioned as the principal material in harmony textbooks, must be transferred from the study of harmony to the study of counterpoint; and second, that I therefore could not possibly maintain the division between the theoretical and practical parts as is otherwise customary. For if, in contrast to the theory of counterpoint, the theory of harmony presents itself to me as a whole as a purely intellectual world, as a world of ideally driving forces, whether born of nature or art, then the division—insofar as it should be made at all in such abstract material—had to be carried out in such a way that the merely topographical aspects of the material belong to the theoretical part: thus systems, intervals, triads and multi-note chords, etc.; whereas the truly functional, the driving force of the fundamental musical ideas: namely scale degree progression, chromaticization, and modulation, etc., are counted as part of the practical section.

I believed I should place particular value throughout on the biological moments in the life of tones. May we finally become comfortable with the thought that tones truly have their own life, which in its animality appears more independent of the artist than one dared to assume!

I could only do justice to this elevated conception of the independent life of tones in the reality of artworks by always seeking to illustrate all artistic experiences or doctrines abstracted into words through living examples—and only through living examples—from the masters themselves.

At several points in this book (§84 and others), reference is made to a new theory of counterpoint that is in preparation. A logical and natural disposition of the entire material, also the historical circumstance that the practice of counterpoint is of older date than that of scale degrees, but particularly my own conception expressed here would have required that I first present the theory of practical voice-leading and only then the more abstract theory of harmony. Nevertheless, I considered it more appropriate and useful at this time to begin with the theory of harmony, because the conditions I have observed here made it seem inadvisable to me to delay even briefly the initiation of a reform process.

For the same reason, I will not fail to publish, even before the publication of my "Psychology of Counterpoint," a supplementary work under the title "On the Decline of the Art of Composition—a Technical-Critical Investigation," to reinforce and make useful the present theory of harmony.

Finally, a brief remark about my rejection in §9 of the explanation of the minor triad from the theory of the undertone series. Precisely the consequence that Riemann finally and quite rightly drew from this theory—that in the minor triad the root should truly be assumed to be above and the fifth below—demonstrates all the more its untenable nature. For if theory is to elucidate art as it has developed and as it is, and not vice versa, then it must respect the fact that artists have always based scale degree progression in principle only on the roots in the bass and have carried this through everywhere with equal vigor, without regard to the appearance of the minor triad in itself, both in major and in the minor system. This argument, as a purely artistic one, would have to be recognized as valid even if the acoustic phenomenon of the undertone series were more securely proven than it actually appears today.

Finally, the problem comes down to this: given that the minor triad does not at all contradict the overtone series with at least two elements—the root and the fifth—and that its treatment in psychologically artistic terms runs parallel to that of the major triad, which after all is founded on the overtone series; given such necessarily decisive circumstances, is it advisable to dislodge the minor triad from such a secure conception and to force it, merely because of the minor third alone, into the far more dubious conception of the "undertone series," where all three elements fall onto the shaky ground of a hypothesis and, moreover, the new conception of the root in the upper position so greatly contradicts the instincts and practice of artists with respect to scale degree progression?
