## DEDICATION

### TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND MOST REVEREND LORD
### THE LORD VINCENZO DIEDO
### PATRIARCH OF VENICE

The Ancient Sages were of common opinion that all things, through the desire they have to return to their origin, are naturally inclined to their proper operation and to attain their perfection. Wherefore, Science being the perfection of the Intellect, and Understanding and Knowledge being the proper operation of Man, by means of which he comes to join himself to his Principle: from this it follows that everyone is naturally drawn to the knowledge of things, nor does he ever tire or satiate himself in going to investigate their causes and to wish to understand the high secrets of Nature. 

Nor do I think that the hope of acquiring knowledge of many things alone spurs him to this, but even of a single thing: because in knowing it he understands that he is walking toward perfection; and he judges that in this, surpassing all others, it is a thing worthy of much praise and honorable.

Therefore I believe that men, loving to hold the first place in some faculty, day by day, now adding one thing and now another, have caused the Sciences and Arts to grow in such a way that it is almost impossible to see from what side one might add anything new to them. And although it could be said that each of them has had this good fortune, perhaps because of the profit that men derive from them; nevertheless, until now it seems to me, if I am not mistaken, that Music has been somewhat unfortunate: because although many authors are found who have written many things about the Science and the Art, nevertheless a man reading them cannot acquire from them that knowledge which he desires: because truly they have not touched sufficiently, nor shown anything of those things that are of great importance.

### Zarlino's Purpose in Writing

Wherefore I, who from my tender years have always had a natural inclination to Music, having already consumed a good part of my age in the knowledge of her, having perceived this thing, wished to try whether I could in some manner draw the things that pertain to Theory and Practice toward their perfection, to do something pleasing to all those who delight in such a faculty. And although I knew that this was too heavy a burden for me, nevertheless I thought that even if I was not going to reduce them to their ultimate degree of perfection, at least I would perhaps have been able to direct the matter in such a way that I would have been the cause of giving courage to some noble spirit to pass even further beyond.

Wherefore, having proposed this end to myself, and having written these **INSTITUTIONS** in past years, which teach the things pertaining to one and the other of the named parts, encouraged by my friends who judged they could be useful to Students, I have decided to send them into the light, dedicating them to Your Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Lordship. 

### Reasons for the Dedication

And I have been moved to do this primarily to show in some part how much I am obliged for the kindnesses shown to me by you; then, because if perchance there should be anyone of such malign spirit who, not having respect that I do it with the intention of helping others, should move to criticize these my labors, at least he would be constrained to have regard for the Most Illustrious name of that Lord to whom they have been dedicated.

Beyond this is added that, your singular prudence, justice, religion, and benignity—things in you known and praised by all—having given birth in me to an incredible reverence and devotion, I had no other way or means to be able to demonstrate it. 

### The Virtues of Patriarch Diedo

Nor can one truly have doubt of the singular virtues of Your Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Lordship, since clear testimony has been given of them by that most wise Senate, which, through many experiences having known how prudent you were in the governments of the Republic, both in the city and outside, in the regencies of Verona and Udine, ultimately finding yourself in Padua as magistrate when the death of the Most Reverend Contarini occurred, judging you worthy of such honor, elected you Patriarch of Venice.

And although honors obtained most often change the minds and customs of men, nevertheless, though you have attained such an honored rank, the goodness of your spirit has not changed or diminished in the slightest; rather it has greatly increased, as can clearly be seen: for immediately upon attaining this dignity, you turned first to adorning the Church, and then, with the greatest expense, to repairing the Palace, which was already beginning to fall into ruin. 

But just as you continually do not cease to renew and adorn the material church, so from day to day (which is the most evident sign of religion and charity) you do not cease to succor and sustain the spiritual one, continually offering help to the Poor; not only to those of your city, but also to foreigners, and to those who, departing from infidelity, come to Christianity. And as a vigilant pastor and diligent farmer and guardian of the Lord's Vineyard, you attend to ensuring that your flock is not harmed by Wolves, and that from that Vineyard are removed the branches that are not good, or else they are governed in such a manner that they become fruitful.

### Conclusion

All these things truly give the clearest testimony to the World of your rare virtues, which have moved me to dedicate to you these my labors, such as they are. And although the gift is small, at least regard the devotion of my spirit toward you, which is infinitely great.
