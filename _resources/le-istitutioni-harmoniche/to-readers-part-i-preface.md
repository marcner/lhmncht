## AI LETTORI (TO THE READERS)

If I see, my most kind readers, that these labors of mine are truly dear to you, I will strive to give you, as soon as I can make it, these same institutions made in the Latin language, along with the HARMONIC DEMONSTRATIONS mentioned in several places of this work, and some other things besides, to which I have not yet (as they say) put the final hand. In the meantime, read with a cheerful and sincere spirit that which I have labored over for many years to benefit you. And if you find anything that does not fully satisfy you, remember that I am human; and I do not think, as that good old Terentian used to say, that anything pertaining to man is foreign to me. I mean to infer that it could very well be that I have erred in something, since we are all subject to such law. And that this is true, you can now recognize from the fact that despite all the diligence that has been used in printing, it has not been possible to prevent some errors from occurring in several sheets of some books (though not in all); which you will gladly correct before you begin reading. By doing this, you will show how kind you are in pardoning those [errors] that might be (if any are found) of some importance and cannot be understood except by the intellect. The first number is that of the page of the work, and the second that of the line.

### Proemio

**M**any times thinking to myself and turning over in my mind various things that the supreme God has through His benignity given to mortals, I have clearly understood that among the most marvelous is having granted them the particular grace of using articulated voice; by means of which alone man was made capable, above other animals, of being able to send forth all those thoughts that he had conceived within his mind. And there is no doubt that through it is manifestly shown how much he differs from beasts and how much he is their superior. And I believe that one can truly say that this gift has been of the greatest utility to human generation: because no other thing, if not speaking, induced and drew men, who at first were scattered in the forests and mountains, living almost the life of beasts, to gather together to inhabit and live in company, according to what is required by human nature, and to build cities and castles; and united by virtue of good orders to preserve themselves, and dealing one with another, to offer help in all their needs.

Having thus come through this way to live together and joined, it was then recognized day by day through experience how great was the power of speech, even though rough. Wherefore some of elevated intellect in speaking began to put into practice some ornate and delightful manners, with beautiful and illustrious sentences, striving to surpass other men in that by which men remain superior to other animals. Not remaining satisfied with this, they attempted to go even further, always seeking to raise themselves to a higher grade of perfection. And having for this purpose added harmony to speech, they began from it to investigate various rhythms and diverse meters, which when accompanied with harmony bring the greatest delight to our soul.

Having discovered, then (among others, which are many) one manner of composition that they called hymn, they also found heroic, tragic, comic, and dithyrambic poetry; and with number, with speech, and with harmony they could with these sing the praises and render glory to the Gods; and with these, according to their pleasure, more easily and with greater force restrain unbridled souls, and with greater delight move the wills and appetites of men, reducing them to a tranquil and orderly life. Having happily achieved this, they acquired among the peoples such authority that they were much more esteemed and honored than others. And these, who arrived at such knowledge, without any distinction were called Musicians, Poets, and Sages.

But understanding at that time by Music a supreme and singular doctrine, Musicians were held in great esteem, and an inestimable reverence was shown to them. Although now, whether through the malignity of the times or through the negligence of men, who have made little account not only of Music but of other studies as well, from that supreme height in which it was placed, it has fallen into extreme baseness; and where incredible honor was once paid to it, it has then been considered vile and abject, and so little esteemed that it is scarcely recognized by learned men for what it is. And this seems to me to have happened because there has remained to it neither part nor any vestige of that venerable gravity that it was anciently accustomed to have. Wherefore everyone has made it permissible to tear it apart and to treat it very badly in many unworthy ways.

Nevertheless, the most good God, to whom it is pleasing that His infinite power, wisdom, and goodness be magnified and manifested by men with hymns accompanied by gracious and sweet accents, it not seeming to Him to allow any longer that that art be held vile which serves His worship, and which here below gives a sign of how much sweetness the songs of the Angels can have, who in heaven stand to praise His majesty, has granted the grace of causing to be born in our times **Adriano Willaert**, truly one of the rarest intellects that practical Music has ever exercised: who, in the manner of a new Pythagoras, minutely examining that which can occur in it, and finding infinite errors in it, has begun to remove them and to restore it toward that honor and dignity that it once had and that it reasonably ought to be; and has shown a reasonable order of composing with elegant manner every musical song, and in his compositions he has given the clearest example of it.

Now because I have understood that there are many, of whom some through curiosity and some truly through wanting to learn desire that someone should take it upon himself to show the way of composing musically with beautiful, learned, and elegant order, I have undertaken the labor of writing the present **INSTITUTIONS**, gathering various things from the good ancients and also finding new ones myself, to make a trial if I might perhaps be able to satisfy in some part such desire and the obligation that man has to benefit other men.

But seeing that just as for one who wishes to be a good painter and to acquire great fame in painting, it is not sufficient merely to apply colors gracefully if he cannot give a sound reason for the work he has made, so for one who desires to have the name of true Musician, it is not sufficient and does not bring much praise to have joined consonances when he does not know how to give account of such union; therefore I have set myself to treat jointly of those things which pertain both to the practice and to the speculation of this science, so that those who will love to be in the number of good Musicians, reading our work carefully, may be able to give reason for their compositions.

And although I know that treating this matter has in itself many difficulties, nevertheless I have good hope that reasoning about it with that brevity that will be possible for me, I will show it clear and most easy, opening all the secrets of it, so that everyone perhaps may in great part remain satisfied by it. But so that one may have easy understanding of this our treatise, it has seemed good to me to divide it into several parts, and in such a manner that they show the things that must be presupposed before one comes to teach the said science.

And because for constructing the order of sounds that are contained in Music, harmonic intervals are necessary, both as to invention and as to position, through the differences that occur among the discovered sounds, therefore I shall first reason about their principles: since we say that we truly know things when we know their principles.

Dividing then the work into four parts, in the first there will be reasoning about Numbers, Proportions, and their operations, not leaving any thing, however small, that pertains to the Musician. In the second we shall speak of Sounds, showing in what way all their intervals necessary to harmony are each accommodated per se to its proportion, and the division of the Monochord in each species of harmony in all the genera. Then having shown the true intervals that can be used in musical concents, we shall show in what way they come to be accommodated in artificial instruments; beyond this, in what way one can fabricate an instrument in which every genus of harmony may be contained.

In the third we shall consider how and with what good order consonances and dissonances ought to be placed in compositions of two [voices], and how they are fitted in those of more voices. In the fourth and last we shall treat of the Modes, otherwise called Tones by practical Musicians, and of their differences; and we shall say in what way harmonies ought to be accommodated to words, and words accommodated under singable figures. So that without any doubt one who will have well learned all these things may deservedly be placed in the number of perfect and honored Musicians.

But before we enter to treat what we have proposed above, I esteem that it cannot be other than pleasing and satisfying to go recounting some things: how the origin and certainty of Music came about, its praises, to what end it ought to be learned, what utility one has from it, in what way we ought to use it, and other similar things.
