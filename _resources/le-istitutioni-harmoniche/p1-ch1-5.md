# CHAPTER ONE: ON THE ORIGIN AND CERTAINTY OF MUSIC

Since the Supreme and Most Excellent God, through His infinite goodness, has granted man the ability to be with stones, to grow with trees, and to sense in common with other animals; yet as He wished that from the excellence of this creature His omnipotence might be known, He endowed him with intellect, so that he differs little from the angels. And so that man might know his beginning and end to be in God, He created him with his face directed toward heaven, where is the seat of God Himself, and this so that he would not fix his love on base and earthly things, but would raise his intellect to contemplate the superior and celestial things, and penetrate to the hidden and divine through the means of things that exist and are comprehended through the five senses. And although two alone would have been sufficient for mere existence; nevertheless for well-being He added three more: for if through touch we know hard and rough things from soft and polished ones; and through taste we distinguish sweet foods from bitter ones; through these two senses we feel the difference between cold and heat, hard and soft, heavy and light—things that would merely suffice for our existence. Nevertheless, for well-being, seeing, hearing, and smelling are necessary; through which man comes to reject what is bad and choose what is good. Of these, whoever wishes to properly estimate their virtue will undoubtedly find that sight, considered by itself, is of greater utility to the body and consequently more necessary than the others. But one will then recognize that hearing is much more necessary and better when considered incidentally in matters pertaining to the intellect: for although through the sense of sight more differences of things are known—being that it extends more than hearing—nevertheless hearing extends more in the acquisition of Sciences and intellectual judgment, and brings us much greater utility. Whence it follows that hearing is truly both more necessary and better than the other senses; although all five are called instruments of the intellect: for everything that we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell is presented to it through the means of the senses and common sense; nor can it have knowledge of anything except through the means of one of these five; it being true that all our knowledge has its origin from them.

From hearing, therefore, as from the most necessary of the other senses, the science of Music has had its origin; whose nobility can easily be demonstrated through its antiquity: for (as Moses, Josephus, and Berosus the Chaldean say) before the universal flood it was discovered by Jubal of the lineage of Cain from the sound of hammers. But lost afterward by the aforementioned flood, it was newly discovered by Mercury: for (as Diodorus holds) he was the first who observed the course of the stars, the harmony of song, and the proportions of numbers. And he also says that he was the inventor of the Lyre with three strings; of which opinion was also Lucian; although Lactantius, in the book he wrote on False Religion, attributes the invention of the Lyre to Apollo; and Pliny holds that Amphion was the inventor of Music. But be that as it may, Boethius, approaching the opinion of Macrobius and departing from Diodorus, holds that Pythagoras was the one who discovered the reason of musical proportions from the sound of hammers: For passing by a blacksmith's shop, where they were beating heated iron on the anvil with various hammers, there came to his ears a certain order of sounds that moved his hearing with delight; and stopping for a while, he began to investigate whence such an effect proceeded; and it seeming to him first that it could proceed from the unequal forces of the men, he had those who were beating exchange hammers: but not hearing a sound different from that of before, he judged (as was true) that the diversity of the weight of the hammers was the cause. For which reason, having had each weighed separately, he found among the numbers of the weights the ratios of consonances and harmonies; which he then industriously increased in this way: having made strings of sheep gut of equal thickness, attaching to them the same weights of the hammers, he found the same consonances; all the more sonorous, as the strings by their nature render sound

# CHAPTER TWO: ON THE PRAISES OF MUSIC

Although through its origin and certainty its praises are clearly manifest, nevertheless when I consider that nothing can be found which does not have a very great connection with Music, I cannot pass over it entirely in silence. And although what has been written about it by so many excellent Philosophers should suffice, nevertheless I do not wish to refrain from my duty to discourse on some things about it: for although I will not say all the praises that belong to it, I will at least touch upon a minimal portion of the most notable and excellent ones; and I will do this with as much brevity as possible.

How celebrated Music has been and held as a sacred thing is most clearly attested by the ancient writings of Philosophers, and especially of the Pythagoreans: for they held the opinion that the World was composed musically, and that the heavens in their turning caused harmony, and that our soul was formed with the same reason, to be awakened by songs and sounds and almost vivify its virtues. So much so that by some of them it was written that Music among the liberal arts holds the primacy, and by some it was called enkyklios paideia, from enkyklos, a Greek word meaning Circle, and paideia Discipline—as if to say the circle of sciences: for Music, as Plato says, embraces all disciplines, as can be known by examination. For if we begin with Grammar, first among the seven liberal arts, we will find what we have said to be true; for great harmony is heard in the arrangement and proportionate order of words, from which if the Grammarian departs, he makes the ears hear a displeasing sound of his speech: for one can barely listen to or read that prose or verse which is devoid of polished, beautiful, ornate, sonorous, and elegant order.

In Dialectic, whoever well considers and examines the proportion of Syllogisms will see with marvelous concert and very great pleasure to the hearing, that truth is shown to be greatly distant from falsehood. The Orator then in his Oration, using musical accents at the proper times, provides marvelous delight to listeners; which the great orator Demosthenes knew very well: for asked three times what was the principal part in the Orator, three times he replied that pronunciation was above every other thing. This was also known (as Cicero and Valerius Maximus demonstrate) by Gaius Gracchus, a man of supreme eloquence: for whenever he had to speak before the people, he kept behind him a servant who was a most perfect musician, who secretly with an ivory Flute gave him the measure, that is, the voice or tone of pronunciation in such a way that whenever he saw him too elevated he restrained him, and seeing him too lowered he incited him.

But then poetry is clearly seen to be so conjoined with music that whoever wished to separate it from music would remain almost as a body separated from the soul. This is confirmed by Plato in the Gorgias, saying: That if anyone should remove from all poetry the melody and number with the measure together, there would be no difference between it and domestic and popular speech. And therefore we see that poets have used very great diligence and marvelous artifice in accommodating words in verses and arranging feet according to the convenience of speech; as Virgil observed throughout his entire poem: for to all three sorts of his speech he accommodates the proper sonority of the verse with such artifice that he properly seems with the sound of words to place before the eyes the things of which he comes to treat. So that where he speaks of love, one sees that he has artfully chosen some soft, sweet, pleasant words and most pleasing to the hearing; and where it was necessary for him to sing of a deed of arms, describe a naval battle, a storm at sea, or similar things where bloodshed, wrath, anger, displeasures of mind enter, and every hateful thing, he made choice of hard, harsh, and displeasing words: so that in hearing and uttering them they bring fear.

And to give some example of this, he, in showing the poverty of Meliboeus's hut, diminishes that word Tuguri by one letter, almost showing with it the present effect; as he also did when he wished to manifest the sorrow of that Nymph who was forced to abandon the pleasing sight of her shepherd; for in that verse "Et longum formose vale, vale (inquit) Iola," making the verse almost interrupted by weeping and sighs, he makes that syllable long which he had first placed short. Then wishing to show how swift Time is, he demonstrates it with a verse composed of many Dactyls, which are feet apt for velocity and to show such an effect, saying: "Sed fugit interea fugit irreparabile tempus." I will now leave off saying how, wishing to show the Carthaginians always enemies and contrary to the Romans, in describing the site of Carthage, he purposely placed that word which should go before, and said: "Italiam contra." And wishing to demonstrate with how much silence the city of Troy was assaulted by the Greeks, he shows it with a verse composed of many Spondees, which are feet by their nature apt for slowness and for weak and idle things, saying: "Invadunt urbem somno vinoque sepultam"; and infinite others which would be too long to recount in this place, of which the work is full. It will suffice now for the ultimate conclusion to say that poetry would be without any grace if it were not given by harmoniously placed words.

Beyond this, I will leave aside saying how much similarity and union Arithmetic and Geometry have with it; and I will say only that if the Architect did not have knowledge of Music, as Vitruvius well demonstrates, he would not know how reasonably to make the tempering of machines, and in Theaters to place the vessels, and dispose buildings well and musically. Astronomy likewise, if it were not aided by harmonic foundations, would not know the good and evil influences. Indeed I will say more: if the Astronomer did not know the concordance of the seven planets and when one is conjoined with the other, or one is opposed to the other, he would never predict future things. Philosophy also, which has as its proper function to discourse with reason on things produced by nature and possible to produce, does it not confess that all things depend on the prime mover and are ordered with such marvelous order that there results in the universe a tacit harmony? Behold, first heavy things hold the low place, light things the high, and those of less weight, according to their nature, possess the middle place.

And proceeding further, the Philosophers affirm that the Heavens in revolving make harmony; which although we do not hear, this can happen either through their swift revolution, or through the excessive distance, or through another cause hidden to us. Medicine cannot stand far from this: for if the physician does not have knowledge of Music, how will he know how to proportion hot things with cold in his medicines according to their degrees? And how can he have optimal knowledge of pulses? Which the most learned Herophilus disposed according to the order of musical numbers.

And to rise higher, our Theology, placing in heaven infinite angelic spirits, divides them into nine Choirs and three Hierarchies, as Dionysius the Areopagite writes. These are continually present at the sight of the Divine Majesty and do not cease to sing Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts, as is written in Isaiah. And not only these, but the four Animals also, which in the book of his Revelations are described by Saint John, give praise before the throne of God and sing the same song. Then stand the twenty-four elders before the immaculate Lamb, and with the sound of Harps and most high voices they sing to the Most High God a new song, which is also sung by the voices of Harpists playing on their harps together with the four animals and twenty-four elders. Of these and other almost infinite things pertaining to our purpose the divine Scripture is full, which for brevity we will pass over, it being sufficient only to say for the supreme praise of Music that without making mention of any other science, it alone, according to the testimony of the sacred books, is found in Paradise and is most nobly exercised there. And as in the celestial court it is called Triumphant, so in our earthly court, which is called Militant, with nothing other than Music is the Creator praised and thanked.

But let us now leave aside the superior things and return to those which are produced by nature for the ornament of the world, for we will see everything full of musical concerts. The Sea first has the Sirens, which, if it is permitted to give faith to the writers, make themselves heard to sailors in such a way that, often overcome by their harmony and overcome by sleep, they lose that which above every other thing is most dear to all animals. In the Air and on the Earth together sound the birds, which also with their concerts delight and recreate not only weary minds full of troublesome thoughts but also bodies; for the traveler, often tired from the long journey, recreates his mind, rests his body, and forgets past fatigues through the sweet harmony of the rustic songs of birds of so many various sorts that it would be impossible to recount them. The Rivers and Fountains likewise, fabricated by nature, are wont to give pleasant pleasure to whoever is found near them; and the shepherdess often, to recreate herself, accompanies her rustic song with their noisy concerts.

All these things the most learned Virgil expressed with few words when he said that to the song of Silenus not only the Fauns and other beasts but even the hard Oaks danced; those leaping and these often moving with numerous movements, indicating to us that not only sensible things but also those lacking sense are almost ready and conquered by musical concerts, and become from hard and harsh, gentle and pleasant.

But if so much harmony is found in celestial and terrestrial things, or to speak better, if the world was composed by the Creator full of so much harmony, why should we believe Man to be deprived of it? And if the Soul of the World (as some hold) is nothing other than Harmony, could it be that our Soul is not in us the cause of all harmony and that it is not harmoniously conjoined with the body? Especially since God created man in the likeness of the greater World, called by the Greeks Kosmos, that is ornament or adorned; and having made him in that likeness of lesser quantity, in difference from that he is called mikrokosmos, that is little world: certainly this is not a reasonable thing. Whence Aristotle, wishing to show the musical composition of man, very well said that the vegetative part has to the sensitive, and this to the intellective, the same correspondence that the figure of three sides has to that of four. It is therefore certain that nothing good is found that does not have musical disposition; and Music truly, beyond cheering the mind, also reduces man to the contemplation of celestial things; and has such property that everything to which it is added becomes perfect; and those men are truly happy and blessed who are endowed with it, as the Holy Prophet affirms, saying: Blessed is that people who know jubilation.

By which authority Fulgentius, Bishop of Ruspe, a Catholic doctor, expounding Psalm 65, was moved to say that Music is necessary to the Christian man; For in the science of it beatitude is found. Whence for this I have the boldness to say that those who have no knowledge of this science are to be numbered among the ignorant. In ancient times, as Isidore says, it was no less shameful not to know Music than letters. Therefore it is no wonder if Hesiod, a most famous and most ancient poet, as Pausanias narrates, was excluded from the contest as one who had never learned to play the Harp nor to accompany song with its sound. So also Themistocles, as Cicero narrates, refusing to play the Lyre at the banquet, was reputed less learned and less esteemed.

The contrary we read was in great esteem among the ancients: Linus and Orpheus, both sons of the Gods: for with their sweet song (as is said) they not only sweetened human minds but also beasts and birds; and what is more marvelous to say, moved stones from their proper places and retained rivers in their courses. And this same thing the learned Horace attributed to Amphion, saying: "Dictus and Amphion Thebanae conditor arcis / Saxa movere sono testudinis, et prece blanda / Ducere quo vellet." From these perhaps the Pythagoreans learned that with musical sounds they softened fierce minds; and Asclepiades likewise, who many times by this way calmed discord born in the people, and with the sound of the Trumpet restored hearing to the deaf. Likewise Damon the Pythagorean reduced with song to temperate and honest life some youths given to wine and lust. And therefore those spoke well who affirmed Music to be a certain law and rule of modesty. And I say that Theophrastus found certain musical Modes to calm perturbed spirits. Therefore deservedly and wisely Diogenes the Cynic mocked the Musicians of his times, who, having the strings of their harps concordant, had minds discordant and disordered, being abandoned by the harmony of good customs.

And if we should give faith to history, what we have said should seem almost nothing to us: for much greater is having the power to heal the sick than to correct the life of unbridled youths, as we also read of Xenocrates, who with the sound of organs reduced the mad to pristine health; and of Thales of Candia, who with the sound of the Harp drove out the pestilence. And we see today that through Music marvelous things are worked: for so great is the force of sounds and dances against the poison of Tarantulas that in the briefest time it heals those who have been bitten by them, as is seen every day by experience in Apulia, a country most abundant in such animals.

But without more profane testimonies, do we not have in the Sacred Letters that the prophet David calmed the evil spirit of Saul with the sound of his Harp? And for this I believe that this royal Prophet ordained that in the Temple of God songs and harmonic sounds should be used, knowing that they were apt to gladden spirits and return men to the contemplation of celestial things. The Prophets also (as Ambrose says on Psalm 118), wishing to prophesy, asked that someone skilled in sound should set himself to play; so that softened by that sweetness, spiritual grace might be infused into them. Therefore Elisha did not wish to prophesy to the King of Israel what he should do for the acquisition of waters so that the armies would not die of thirst, if first a Musician was not brought to his presence to sing; and as he sang, he was inspired by the divine Spirit and predicted everything.

But let us pass further, for examples do not lack. Timotheus (as the Great Basil narrates together with many others) with Music incited King Alexander to combat; and the same being incited, calmed him. Aristotle narrates in the book on the nature of animals that Deer are captured by the song of hunters and are also much delighted by the pastoral Bagpipe and song; which Pliny confirms in his natural history. And not to extend myself further on this, I will only say that I know some who have seen Deer that, stopping their course, stood attentive to hear the sound of the Lyre and of the Lute; and likewise we see every day birds conquered and deceived by harmony, most often remaining captured by the fowler. Pliny also narrates that Music saved Arion from death, for when he threw himself into the sea, he was carried by a Dolphin to the shore of Tenarus island.

But let us now leave aside many other examples that we could adduce, and let us speak a little of the good Socrates, master of Plato, who already old and full of wisdom wished to learn to play the harp; and old Chiron, among the first arts that he taught Achilles in tender age, was Music; and he wished that his bloodthirsty hands, before they were stained with Trojan blood, should play the Harp. Plato and Aristotle do not allow that the well-instructed man should be without Music: indeed they persuade with many reasons that such a science should be learned, and they show the force of Music to be very great in us; and therefore they wish that from childhood one should apply oneself to it: for it is sufficient to induce in us a new good habit and such a custom that guides and leads to virtue and renders the mind more capable of happiness. And the most severe Lycurgus, King of the Lacedaemonians, among his most severe laws praised and most highly approved Music; for he knew very well that it was very necessary to man and of very great benefit in matters of war; so that his armies (as Valerius narrates) never went to fight if first they were not well heated and animated by the sound of Fifes.

Such a custom is also observed in our times; for one of two armies would not assault the enemy if not invited by the sound of Trumpets and Drums or by some other sort of musical instruments. And although, beyond those narrated, infinite other examples are not lacking from which the dignity and excellence of Music could be better known, nevertheless, not to go on longer, we will leave them, it being sufficient what has been reasoned until now.

## CHAPTER THREE: TO WHAT END MUSIC SHOULD BE LEARNED

Since it has been said above that the well-instructed man should not be without Music, therefore wishing to learn it, before we pass further, I wish us to see what end he should propose to himself, since there have been diverse opinions about this; and having seen this, we will see also the utility that comes from Music and in what manner we should use it.

Beginning therefore from the first, I say that there have been some who held the opinion that Music should be learned to give pleasure and delight to the hearing, for no other reason than to make this sense perfect, in the way that sight becomes perfect when with delight and pleasure it regards a beautiful and proportionate thing. But in truth it should not be learned for this end, for this is a thing of common folk and mechanics: for these things do not have in themselves any part of the virtuous (although calming the mind they have something delightful) and are things of coarse men, who seek nothing but to satisfy the sense, and to this sole end they attend.

Others then wished that it should be learned for no other end than to be placed among the liberal disciplines, in which only the nobles exercised themselves; and because it disposes the mind to virtue and regulates its passions, accustoming it to rejoice and grieve virtuously, disposing it to good customs, no differently than Gymnastics does for the body to some good disposition and habit; and also so that by such means one could come to the speculation of diverse sorts of harmony: since through it the intellect knows the nature of musical consonances. And although this end has something honest about it, it is nevertheless not sufficient: for he who learns Music does not learn it only to acquire the perfection of the intellect; but to be able, when he ceases from the cares and business both of the body and of the mind—that is, when he is at leisure and outside of daily occupations—to pass the time and entertain himself virtuously; so that living rightly and laudably distant from laziness, by such means he may become more prudent and then pass to doing better and more laudable things. Which end is not only worthy of praise and honest, but is the true end: for Music was not discovered or ordained to any other end than to that which we have shown above, as the Philosopher manifests in his Politics, adducing and recounting many authorities of Homer.

Whence deservedly the ancients placed it in the order of those entertainments that serve free men and among laudable disciplines, and not among the necessary ones, as is Arithmetic; nor even among the useful ones, as are some which are for the acquisition only of exterior goods, which are riches and the utility of the family; nor among some others which serve for the health of the body and for strength, like Gymnastics, which is an art pertaining to things that help to make the body healthy and strong, such as wrestling, throwing the javelin, and other things that pertain to the exercise of war.

One should therefore learn Music not as necessary but as liberal and honest, so that by its means we may come to a good and virtuous habit that leads us in the way of good customs, making us walk to other more useful and more necessary sciences, and makes us pass the time virtuously. And this should be the principal or ultimate intention, whichever we wish to call it. But in what mode it has the power to induce new customs and move the mind to diverse passions, we will reason about in another place.

---

## CHAPTER FOUR: ON THE UTILITY THAT ONE HAS FROM MUSIC, AND THE STUDY THAT WE SHOULD PUT INTO IT, AND IN WHAT MODE TO USE IT

Great truly is the utility that is taken from Music when we use it temperately: for it is a manifest thing that not only man, who is capable of reason, but also many of the other animals that lack it, we comprehend that they take delight and pleasure: for delighting and rejoicing every animal in the proportion and tempering of things, and finding in harmonies such qualities, there immediately follows pleasure and delight common to all the living. And it is truly a reasonable thing, since nature consists in such proportion and tempering, that every like delights in its like and desires it.

Of this, infants barely born give most clear indication, who, taken by the sweetness of the song of the voices of their nurses, not only after long weeping are calmed but become cheerful, also often making some festive gestures. And Music is so natural to us, so conjoined to us in a certain way, that we see each one in a certain mode wanting to say something about it, even if imperfectly. For which reason one could say that he who is not composed with harmony does not take delight in Music: for (as we have said) if all delight and pleasure is born from likeness, it is necessary that he who has no pleasure in harmony, in a certain way does not find it in him and is ignorant of it. And if one wishes to examine the matter well, one will find such a person to be of most base disposition and without any judgment; and one could say that nature failed him, not having proportionately formed his organ: for that part which is in the middle of the brain, being closer to the ear, when it is proportionate and well composed, serves in a certain way for the judgment of harmony, by which man, as by a final thing, is taken and conquered, and in it takes much pleasure.

But if it happens that it is deprived of such proportion, much less does it take delight in any other of it; and it is as apt for speculative and ingenious things as the Ass is for the Lyre. And if we wish in this to follow the opinion of the Astrologers, we will say that at his birth Mercury was made his enemy, as he is favorable to those who not only of harmony take delight, but do not disdain, for the alleviation of their fatigues, to sing and play themselves, recreating their spirit and reacquiring their lost forces. And therefore nature has well ordained that, having in us, through the spirit, conjoined together (as the Platonists hold) body and Soul; to each of them, being weak and infirm, it has provided opportune remedies: for the Body, languid and infirm, comes to be healed with remedies that Medicine provides; and the Spirit, afflicted and weak, by aerial spirits and by sounds and songs that are proportionate remedies to it. The Soul then, enclosed in this corporeal prison, is consoled by way of the high and divine mysteries of sacred Theology.

Such utility therefore Music brings us, and more: that chasing away the tedium that is taken from fatigues, it makes us cheerful, and doubles and preserves cheerfulness. We see Soldiers go to assault the enemy much more ferociously, incited by the sound of Trumpets and Drums; and not only they, but Horses also move with great impetus. This excites the mind, moves the affections, mitigates and calms fury, makes time pass virtuously, and has the power to generate in us a habit of good customs; especially when with due modes and temperately it is used: for being the proper office of Music to delight, not dishonestly but honestly we should use it; so that what is wont to happen to those who immoderately drink Wine does not happen to us—who then, heated, harm themselves and, doing a thousand foolish things, move to laughter whoever sees them. Not because the nature of Wine is so malign that when temperately drunk it does not work good effect in man: but it shows itself such to him who drinks it avidly: for all things are good when temperately they are used for that end for which they have been discovered and ordained; but when they are intemperately used and not according to the due end, they harm and are pernicious.

So that we can hold this for true: that not only natural things, but every art and every science can be good and bad, according to how they are used: good, I say, when they are directed to that end to which they have been ordained; and bad when they distance themselves from that end. Man therefore being born for much more excellent things than Singing or playing the Lyre or other sorts of instruments to satisfy only the sense of hearing, makes bad use of his nature and deviates from his proper end, little caring to give food to the intellect, which always desires to know and understand new things.

Man therefore should not only learn the art of Music, withdrawing from other sciences, abandoning his end, which would be great foolishness: but he should learn it for that end to which it has been ordained. Nor should he spend time only in it: but he should accompany it with the study of speculation, so that aided by that, he can come to greater knowledge of the things that pertain to its use; and through this use he can reduce to act that which through long study speculating he has investigated: for accompanied in this way it brings utility to every science and to every art, as at other times we have seen. And if it were done otherwise, there would not be in it such a thing of much utility nor of much glory; indeed vice would be attributed to him: for to exercise oneself continuously in it without any other study induces sleepiness and laziness and renders minds soft and effeminate.

Which thing the ancients knowing, wished that the study of Music should be conjoined to Gymnastics: nor did they wish that one could apply oneself to one without the other; and this they did so that by giving oneself too much to Music, the mind would not come to make itself vile; and giving oneself only to Gymnastics, minds would not become excessively fierce, cruel, and inhuman: but from these two exercises joined together they would render themselves humane, modest, and temperate. And they moved to this with reason, which clearly can be seen, that those who in youth, abandoning the studies of things of greater importance, have given themselves only to consorting with musicians and parasites, always standing in the schools of games, of dances, and of lutes, playing the Lyre and the Lute, and singing songs less than honest, are soft, effeminate, and without any good custom. For Music used in such a way renders the minds of youths badly composed, as Ovid well demonstrated, saying:

*Enervant animos citharae, cantusque lyraequae,*
*Et vox, et numeris brachia mota suis.*

They reason about nothing other than such things, nor do any but dishonest words come from their filthy mouths. On the contrary, there are some who through such study become not only soft and effeminate but also importunate, displeasing, proud, pertinacious, and inhuman: so much so that seeing themselves arrived at a certain point, esteeming themselves above every other excellent person, they glory, they exalt themselves, they praise themselves, and vituperating others, to appear themselves full of wisdom and judgment, they stand with the greatest reputation and pride in the world. Nor ever, except with great insistence of prayers and with praises much greater than is fitting for them, can they be reduced to showing a little of their knowledge. For which reason in all these the saying of Horace is verified, which says:

*Omnibus hoc vitium est cantoribus, inter amicos,*
*Ut nunquam inducant animum cantare rogati,*
*Injussi nunquam desistant.*

For such people it would have been necessary that their fathers should rather have had them taught some other trade, however vile, for perhaps they would not have fallen into such errors and would have acquired better customs. I have wished to say all this so that those who wish to make profession of the art of Music will fall in love with the science and give themselves to the study of speculation: for I do not doubt that by joining these things together, they will not come to become virtuous, honest, and well-mannered, and in such a way will come to imitate the ancients, who (as has been said) accompanied Music with Gymnastics: for thus it will be powerful to reduce each one to the straight path of good customs. Nor should anyone believe that what I have said about the art of Music I have said either to vituperate it or those who exercise themselves in such a manner—a thing that has never entered my mind—but rather I have said it so that, conjoined in such a way and with other honorable sciences full of severity, we may defend it from the vagabond and idle ruffianisms of the jugglers, and place it in its true place, so that it does not have to serve those who are given only to voluptuousness, but be for the use of the studious of good sciences and of those who follow the virtues, living moderately and civilly.

## CHAPTER FIVE: WHAT MUSIC IS IN GENERAL, AND OF ITS DIVISION

We will therefore make a beginning to such an honest and honorable study, seeing first what Music is, and then of how many sorts it is found, assigning to each sort its definition; and this we will do so as not to deviate from the good order that the ancients maintained, who wished that every discourse on whatever thing that is reasonably made should begin with the definition, so that one understands what one has to dispute about. Therefore, speaking in general, I say that Music is nothing other than Harmony; and we can say that it is that strife and friendship that Empedocles posited, from which he wished all things to be generated—that is, a discordant concord, as one would say, Concord of various things that can be joined together. But because this word Music has diverse significations, and reason requires that everything that carries many significations should first be divided before being defined (especially wishing to declare every part of it), therefore we will first divide it, saying: Music being of two sorts, Animastic and Organic.

One is harmony that is born from the composition of various things joined together in one body, although among themselves they are discrepant, such as is the mixture of the four Elements, or of other qualities in an animate body. The other is harmony that can be born from various instruments. And this we will again divide in two: for two sorts of instruments are found, that is, Natural and Artificial. The natural ones are those parts that concur in the formation of voices, such as the Throat, the Palate, the Tongue, the Lips, the Teeth, and finally the Lung, formed by nature. Which parts being moved by the Will, and from the movement of them being born sound, and from sound Speech, there is then born Modulation, or Singing: and thus by the movement of the body, by the reason of sound, and by the words accommodated to Song, perfect harmony is made, and there is born the Music called Harmonic or Natural.

The artificial instruments are human inventions and derive from Art, and form Artificial Music, which is that harmony that is born from similar instruments; and this is made in three modes: for it is born from instruments that render sound with natural breath, artificialized, such as Organs, Fifes, Trumpets, and similar; or from stringed instruments where breath is not needed, such as Harps, Lyres, Lutes, Harpsichords, Dulcimers, and similar, which are struck by fingers and quills, or are played with bows. Or finally from instruments to be beaten, such as Drums, Cymbals, Tabors, Bells, and other similar ones made of hollow wood and of skins of animals stretched over, and of metal, when they are struck by whatever thing one wishes.

So that the Artificial is found of three sorts: From breath, From strings, and From beating; and the Natural of four: Plain, Measured, Rhythmic, and Metric; although these four can also be attributed to the artificial, for the reasons we will say elsewhere. Of Animastic we will likewise make two parts, placing in the first the Mundane, and in the second the Human, as appears in the subjoined division.

[Here appears the diagram showing the divisions of MUSICA into Mondana (Mundane), Anima-stica (Animastic), and Humana (Human), with further subdivisions into harmónica o naturale (Harmonic or Natural) and Arteficia ta (Artificial), which then branches into Piana (Plain), Misurata (Measured), Arteficia ta (Artificial), Rithmica (Rhythmic), and Metrica (Metric), with the artificial further divided into Da fiato (From breath), Da chor-de (From strings), and Di Batte re (From beating)]

And although some have made a difference between the Music that is born from wind instruments, naming it Organic, from that which is born from strings and without breath, calling it Rhythmic, nevertheless I have wished to call one and the other indifferently Artificial. First, because it is not of much importance to name them more in one way than in another; and then to preserve the signification of the word Organ, whence comes this name Organic, which comprehends in general all sorts of artificial instruments; and beyond this to avoid equivocation: for saying Rhythmic, one could understand not only of that harmony that is born from artificial stringed instruments but also of that which results from well-composed Prose. But let us now see what each member of the above-demonstrated division is.
