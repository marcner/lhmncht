## FIRST BOOK ON THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF SOUND.

### FIRST PROPOSITION.

To determine whether sound exists before it is received in the ear, that is to say before it is heard, & if it is different from the movement of air.

IT IS customary to ask at the beginning of treatises on sciences, whether they have some true object, and what it is, for it is useless to speak without knowing what one is talking about; it is therefore appropriate before proceeding further to know if Sound, which is the subject, or the object of Music and hearing, has a real existence, and what it is: for there are many who believe that Sound is nothing if it is not heard, and that it is a simple impression of air that should not be called Sound unless there is some ear that hears it and distinguishes it from other things; certainly if this is so, then hearing must give it the nature of Sound, just as imagination and understanding give existence to imaginary thoughts and phantasms, which are called beings of reason. As for myself, I believe that Sound is no less real before it is heard than light, or colors, and the objects of other external senses before they are perceived, and that Sounds would not cease to be what they are, even if there were no ear. This I would always say, even if I had admitted that Sound was not different from the movement of air.

However, it seems that Sound is something other than this movement, since we feel great movements of air, or water, or some other similar bodies, which make no Sound, or which make it so feeble that it is not at all proportional to the force of the movement, as we experience with stones thrown in the air with slings, with arquebus balls, with artillery shots, and in several other movements, which occur when rain and hail fall, and when the water of a deep river flows without making noise.

On the contrary, there are small movements that make great noises, such as those of the larynx, the epiglottis and the tongue, when we speak, or those of the air, which sounds the Organs, and other Flutes. Nevertheless, I do not think that Sound is different from the movement of the body, which strikes the Drum, or the Membrane of the ear: for it is not necessary to add a quality of the third species, which is ordinarily called passive quality; inasmuch as the movement of air is sufficient to explain everything that is done by Sounds. For as soon as this movement has struck the membrane of the ear, which encloses the interior air, & the spirits that serve hearing, the movement of exterior air communicates to the interior spirits, either by means of the small bone that is suspended on the nerve of hearing, which strikes another small bone as if on an anvil, or in some other manner, which Physicians should treat more particularly.

As for the difficulty of great movements that produce, it seems, no Sound, & the small movements that make great Sounds, one can say that air is not as agitated in these great movements as one thinks, for when one strikes the air with a stick, with the hand, or with stones, arrows, bullets, &c., it gives way easily, since there is no body that prevents it from fleeing; but it receives a greater violence from the movement & the resistance of the organs, which serve in speech, & in Music, than from the movement of any other sort of body, whose noise & whistling is not heard from as far as speech.

One must therefore conclude that all movements which are made in air, in water, or elsewhere, can be called Sounds; inasmuch as they lack only an ear delicate and subtle enough to hear them; & one can say the same thing of the noise of thunder & of cannon with respect to a deaf person, who does not perceive these great noises; for the movement, or the trembling that he feels, is not called Sound, except insofar as it is capable of making itself felt by the spirits of hearing: so that Sound can be defined as a movement of exterior or interior air capable of being heard; I said, or of interior, because of the noises that occur inside the ear. But it is difficult to find precisely what makes the movement of air capable of being heard; for when I consider that a gut string, or brass string stretched in the air, & attached to two walls with nails or pegs sealed in the wall, & touched by the finger, by a bow, or by a feather, makes almost no noise, & when stretched on the bridges of a Lute, a Viol, or a Spinet, it makes a great noise, and nevertheless it is the same percussion of air: that the wind cut & divided by a piece of wood similar to that of the mouthpiece of a Flute tube, makes only a light whistling, & when it is followed by the body of a flute, it makes such a great noise, this makes me conclude that what makes this movement capable of being heard, is nothing other than when it shakes a quantity of enclosed air capable of shaking its prison, & of communicating to the neighboring exterior air until it arrives at the ear.

From this it comes that the bodies which are the most airy, are also the most resonant, & that the most terrestrial and the heaviest are the least, as generally wood is more resonant than metals, when they are used for the tables of instruments: & that among metals lead is the least resonant, & among woods fir which is the lightest & the most airy of all is also the most resonant, & massive and heavy beech is less so: & among firs the driest & the most divested of its terrestrial humidity is found to be the most resonant. Now it should be noted the term, which is used to express this quality of bodies, which makes them multiply the first percussion of air until it is rendered capable of touching the senses of hearing, namely resonant, as if one would say once again sonant, for this expression expresses the sound which comes to our ear, which is not the first Sound, but the multiplied echo from the first air which touches the string up to that which touches the ear; & what we call Echo, is the Sound rendered & returned by the instrument which multiplies the Sound, & reflects it as mirrors reflect light.

We can explain the multiplication of Sound by that of the heat of air which is heated by a great fire, inasmuch as just as we do not immediately feel the heat of fire, if we do not touch it, but that of the heated air: likewise no ear can feel any Sound other than that which is multiplied, & which proceeds from the first. All this does not, however, prevent Sound from being called a collision or beating of air, which bodies make in the medium that receives the movement, & which is struck or broken & divided by the bodies that produce or that receive the movement, since this collision is the cause that we perceive this movement, when it alters, or moves the spirits of hearing, & that the cause can receive the name of its effect.
