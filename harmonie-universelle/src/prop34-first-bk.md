## Propositions 34 from the First Book on the Nature of Sounds

*First see the general Preface, and the particular one.*

*Besides the Propositions there are several Corollaries which contain many remarks.*

---

**I.** To determine if Sound is made before it is received by hearing, and if it is different from the movement of air. [Link](first-book-nature-and-properties-of-sound.md)

**II.** To determine how movement and Sound are made; and why several movements, however very swift, make no Sound that we can hear, such as those of several wheels both in water and in air; and nevertheless several very slow movements make great sounds. *Page 3.*

**III.** To determine if Sound is the movement of exterior air, or of interior air, which is in the bodies that produce sound; and if no sound can be made without the movement of one or the other. *Page 6.*

**IV.** To determine if sound can be made in universal or particular vacuum. *Page 8.*

**V.** To explain how air moves when its movement produces sound, and what movements make no sound. *Page 9.*

**VI.** Sounds have the same ratio among themselves as the movements of air by which they are produced. *Page 11.*

**VII.** To explain how the grave and acute sound is made, and what makes it strong or weak. *Page 11.*
*See the 16th Proposition of the book of the Voice, where I speak more amply of this.*

**VIII.** Sound is not communicated in a moment, as does light, according to all its extent, but in a space of time. *Page 14.*
*Note that it is necessary to correct all that is said of the speed of sound in this Proposition, following what is in the 9th Proposition on the utility of harmony.*

**IX.** Sound does not depend so much on bodies by which it is produced, as light depends on the illuminating body. *Page 16.*

**X.** To explain in what way sound is more subtle than light, and if it reflects. *Page 18.*

**XI.** Sound represents the greatness and other qualities of bodies by which it is produced. *Page 19.*

**XII.** To determine in what proportion sounds diminish from the place where they are produced, until they cease entirely. *Page 20.*

**XIII.** To determine if sound is swifter than the movement of bodies by which it is produced. *Page 21.*

**XIV.** To determine if sound passes through transparent and opaque bodies, and how it is aided or hindered by all sorts of bodies. *Page 24.*

**XV.** The sphere of the extent of sound is all the greater as it is stronger, although two or several sounds are not heard from two or several times as far as one of them. *Page 25.*

**XVI.** To determine if sounds have all sorts of dimensions, namely length, breadth, and depth, and what are the other properties or circumstances of sound. *Page 28.*

**XVII.** To determine why one hears better by night than by day; and if one can know how much warmer air is rarer than cold, and by how much it is rarer than water. *Page 30.*

**XVIII.** To determine why one hears better the sounds from outside a room when one is inside, than those from inside when one is outside. *Page 33.*

**XIX.** To determine if sound is heard better from low to high than from high to low. *Page 33.*

**XX.** Sounds hinder one another when they meet. *Page 34.*

**XXI.** Sounds can serve to measure the earth, and to make known news of what is done in all the world, in little time. *Page 36.*
*See the ninth Proposition on the utility of harmony.*

**XXII.** One can use the sounds of each musical instrument, and the different movements given to them, to discourse on all sorts of subjects, and to teach the sciences. *Page 39.*

**XXIII.** The force of sounds is multiplied by Rhythmic movements, and by the quality of bodies and blows by which they are produced. *Page 41.*

**XXIV.** One can represent the quadrature of the circle, the duplication of the cube, and all things in the world subject to quantity, by the same means of sounds. *Page 41.*

**XXV.** In what way sound is different from light, and in what way it is similar to it. *Page 44.*

**XXVI.** How Echo is made, or the reflection of sounds. *Page 48.* Treatise on Echo. *Page 50.*

**XXVII.** What are the distances and lengths of the vocal line of Echo: if one can know the place from which it responds, and of what length the said line should be, to make the Echo of as many syllables as one wishes. *Page 56.*
*See the 11th Proposition of the third book.*

**XXVIII.** To explain all the figures proper for making artificial Echoes, the Conic sections, and their principal properties. *Page 59.*
*This is done in the following Propositions, from the 25th up to the 51st Proposition of the book of the Voice, and in the fifth Proposition of the book on the utility of harmony, to which it is necessary to join this one.*

**XXIX.** To determine if sounds break, that is to say if they undergo refraction, like light, when they pass through different mediums. *Page 63.*

**XXX.** By how much the sound of the same instrument is graver in water than in air; and if one can infer from that by how much air is rarer than water. *Page 67.*
*See also the first Proposition of the book on utility.*

**XXXI.** If acute sound is more agreeable and more excellent than grave. *Page 71.*
*See also the third Proposition of the 4th book of Composition.*

**XXXII.** To determine if there is any movement in nature, and what is necessary to establish it. *Page 74.*

**XXXIII.** To consider the movements of bodies in general, and the space in which they are made. *Page 76.*

**XXXIV.** To demonstrate if the string stretched by a peg, or by a weight, is equally stretched in all its parts; and if the force which tightens it communicates its impression more quickly and more strongly to the parts which are near it, than to those which are more distant from it.
